# Salt Lake City International Airport

### About This Facility
Salt Lake City International Airport (IATA: SLC, ICAO: KSLC, FAA LID: SLC) is a civil-military airport located about 4 miles (6.4 km) west of Downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, in the United States. The airport is the closest commercial airport for more than 2.5 million people and is within a 30-minute drive of nearly 1.3 million jobs. The airport serves as a hub for Delta Air Lines and is a major gateway to the Intermountain West and West Coast. The airport sees 343 scheduled nonstop airline departures per day to 93 cities in North America and Europe. (Wikipedia)

### Airspace
The airspace around SLC (Class B) is highly complex, with SLC TRACON (S56) owning multiple areas from the surface up to FL230. Due to a significant amount of high terrain being located near the SLC airport, it is recommended that controllers reference the Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) video map and/or terrain display.

### Instrument Procedures
SLC is served by six RNAV arrivals, though four of these are only applicable depending on the airfield configuration (north or south flow). The RNAV arrivals are automated and terminate either at an Initial Approach Fix (IAF) for the arrival runway or on a long downwind. SLC is served by five RNAV SIDs, two of which are airfield configuration dependent. All SIDs require vectoring to the first fix. According to source documentation, the following headings have been pre-assigned to departing aircraft.

| SID    | Heading                             |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| ARCHZ1 | 280 (North Flow Only)               | 
| CGULL1 | 280                                 |
| DEZRT1 | 280                                 |
| RUGGD2 | 280 (South Flow) / 340 (North Flow) |
