# KORD - Chicago O'Hare International Airport

## About ORD
O'Hare International Airport (IATA: ORD, ICAO: KORD, FAA LID: ORD), typically referred to as O'Hare Airport, Chicago O'Hare, or simply O'Hare, is an international airport located on the Northwest Side of Chicago, Illinois, 17 miles (27 km) northwest of the Loop business district. Operated by the Chicago Department of Aviation and covering 7,627 acres (3,087 ha), O'Hare has non-stop flights to 228 destinations in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania as of 2018.

Designed to be the successor to Chicago's Midway International Airport, nicknamed the "busiest square mile in the world," O'Hare began as an airfield serving a Douglas manufacturing plant for C-54 military transports during World War II. It was named after Edward "Butch" O'Hare, the U.S. Navy's first Medal of Honor recipient during that war. As the first major airport planned after World War II, O'Hare's innovative design pioneered concepts such as concourses, direct highway access to the terminal, jet bridges, and underground refueling systems.

O'Hare became famous during the jet age, holding the distinction as the world's busiest airport from 1963 to 1998; today, it is the world's sixth-busiest airport, serving 83 million passengers in 2018. In 2019, O'Hare had 919,704 aircraft movements, averaging 2,520 per day, the most of any airport in the world in part because of a large number of regional flights. O'Hare serves as a major hub for both United Airlines (which is headquartered in Willis Tower) and American Airlines. It is also a focus city for Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines. (Wikipedia)

## Airspace
The C90 (Chicago TRACON) airspace is fairly large and covers multiple smaller airports in the region from the surface to 15,000-ft in most places. 

## Procedures
O'Hare is served by many RNAV STARs and a single conventional SID. The RNAV STARs are not overly automated and will require the controller to manage aircraft descents once in the C90 airspace. The ORD7 SID is strictly a vector SID. Although no headings are published as part of the SID, recommended departure headings have been assigned to departures based upon their departure direction. The initial departure headings are listed in the table below:

| Departure Area | Fixes                                               | Runway | Heading |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|
| North          | PMPKN, RAYNR                                        | 27L    | 300°    |
| East           | DUFEE, EBAKE, MOBLE, LEWKE (LEWKE not part of ORD7) | 27L    | 320°    |
| South          | ACITO, BACEN, CMSKY                                 | 22L    | 180°    |
